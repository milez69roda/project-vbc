<p>Disclaimer: Payment of fees:</p>

<p>All amounts payable pursuant to the application for membership and/or membership renewal and/or membership upgrade should be paid by cheque or credit card. In case of payment by i??cheque, the full amount of the contracted period for membership in advance is accepted. In the case of credit card, payments can be made on a monthly basis. After the contractual period of the membership, the membership will renew automatically unless the member terminates the agreement by giving the Company 30 days written notice. All such notices should be sent to membership@vandaboxing.com. Please note that verbal notices will not be acknowledged. Termination request must be made in writing.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Termination</p>

1. Except as provided for in Clause 3 herein-above, and Clause 6 below, there shall be no termination of membership by the member upon the date this Agreement is signed. The Member, understand and acknowledges that non-usage of the facilities does not release him/her from any obligations to make all payments agree upon, including all administrative fees and monthly dues payments.

2. If person or persons must cancel the membership out of no fault of their own through being relocated via employment, or have to depart from Singapore, then a cancellation fee of $300.00 must be made, and the cancellation must be made in writing at membership@vandaboxing.com 30 days before the termination is to take place. Proof of departure must be shown on applying for cancellation.

 I have read and agree to the terms and conditions listed above. I confirm that the information I have supplied on this application is true and accurate. I understand that membership of the club requires adherence to the published club rules at all times and that failure to do so will result in termination of membership and all associated privileges.
